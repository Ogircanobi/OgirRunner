# Ogir-Runner
Repository for my first game project: working title is OgirRun

This game was made following a YouTube tutorial : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY9MnQ4x3zk
So far the following changes have been made: 

1. I have changed the player images and background to a sci-fi Mars theme. 
2. Speed of enemies is now a gradual increase starting off nice and slow and increasing as your score gets higher. 
3. Adjusted rectangles to be smaller since collision detection was too sensitive: The player was triggering a hit before visible contact with enemy. Also added a single variable to adjust floor level in player class
