# Ogir-Runner
Repository for my first game project: working title is OgirRun

This game was made following a youtube tutorial : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY9MnQ4x3zk
So far the following changes have been made: 

1. I have changed the player imanges and background to a sci-fi mars theme. 
2. Speed of enemies is now a gradual increase starting off nice and slow and increasing as your score gets higher.
